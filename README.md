# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Create a FireBase database
   ```bash
   https://firebase.google.com/?hl=pt-br
   ```
5. Create a file called ".env" and fill in the environment variables with your database data
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=agenda-monitoria.firebaseapp.com
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=agenda-monitoria
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=agenda-monitoria.appspot.com
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=807033164096
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:807033164096:web:b677a6a9ebc64dc29e2aa5
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
